Traffic project implements an artificial neural network to identify which traffic sign appears in a photograph. I experimented with different approaches for upgrading the performance of my
network. A short summary is provided below. For upgrading the performance of my network I tried a couple of different approaches. Firstly, I started with the simplest network without
convolution and hidden layers, but its performance was poor. My next step was to try adding one layer of convolution with max-pooling using (2,2) size and a dropout value of 0.5. This
improved results drastically, as I believe that it helped to extract useful information from the photos with the 32 'filters' I chose to apply. Adding the second layer of convolution (with
max-pooling using (2,2) size and a dropout value of 0.5) upgraded the resulting accuracy even more - I reached my current accuracy of approximately 0.942. However, adding the third layer of
convolution (with max-pooling using (2,2) size and dropout value of 0.5) made the performance worse. After experimenting with the optimal number of convolution layers, I moved straight on to
determining one of the hidden layers. I found out that having one hidden is the best solution as my adding of an additional one has not improved any results at all. Moreover, the optimal
quantity of units in the hidden layer turned out to be 128, as increasing their number did not improve the network's performance, and decreasing this value had a negative effect on the
accuracy. For the review of the performance of the network, see the following video: https://vimeo.com/895900284
