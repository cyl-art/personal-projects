# personal-projects
This repository contains my personal projects. A short descrition of each project is listed below, and a more detailed one in the `overview.txt` file available in each project. 

- Traffic-identification: uses opencv-python, tensorflow, numpy, and a scikit-learn library, implements an artificial neural network to identify traffic signs. For the performance recording, please see the following video: https://vimeo.com/741085007.
- Pagerank: implements an algorithm to rank web pages by importance.
- Sales-prediction: implements an algorithm to predict whether online shopping customers will complete a purchase.
- Minesweeper: implements a minesweeper game where a user is allowed to play against a bot as well as the other user.
- Nim: learns to play Nim from scratch using reinforcement learning.
- Tic-tac-toe: uses Depth First Search, Breadth First Search, and Minimax algorithms to implement Tic-tac-toe game where a user can play against a bot.
- Puzzle: solves logic puzzles by using such logic operations as biconditionals, 'and', 'or', etc. 
- Heredity: predicts how likely a person is to have a certain genetic disease.
- Crossword: focuses on optimization, uses Backtracking Search algorithm, ensures node and arc consistency enforcing.
- Parser: uses Context Free Grammar approach to parse a corpus of sentences.
- Answer-prediction: selects the most appropriate reposnse to a given question based on the corpus of data available, uses nltk library and computes a tf-idf value of the documents to rank their importance.
- Degrees: finds the shortest "path" between given two actors depending on how they can be related by movies, etc.
