# personal-projects
This repository contains my personal projects. A short descrition of each project is listed below, and a more detailed one in the `overview.txt` file available in each project. 

- Degrees: finds the shortest "path" between given two actors depending on how they can be related by movies, etc.
- Tic-tac-toe: uses Depth First Search, Breadth First Search, and Minimax algorithms to implement Tic-tac-toe game where a user can play against a bot.
- Puzzle: solves logic puzzles by using such logic operations as biconditionals, 'and', 'or', etc. 
- Minesweeper: implements a minesweeper game where a user is allowed to play against a bot as well as the other user.
- Pagerank:
- Heredity: Uses implementations of Markov Chains and focuses on probability operations.
- Crossword: focuses on optimization, uses Backtracking Search algorithm, ensures node and arc consistency enforcing.
- Shopping:
- Nim: Uses scikit-learn library and principles of reinforcement learning.
- Traffic-identification: uses opencv-python, tensorflow, numpy, and a scikit-learn library, implements an artificial neural network to identify traffic signs. For the performance recording, please see the following video: https://vimeo.com/741085007
- Parser: uses Context Free Grammar approach to parse a corpus of sentences.
- Questions: selects the most appropriate reposnse to a given question based on the corpus of data available, uses nltk library and computes a tf-idf value of the documents to rank their importance.
